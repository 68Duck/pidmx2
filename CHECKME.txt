Don't allow for sequences to change position. Only allow them to be visible and hidden.

Don't include create light types as probably not needed

In coursework writeup, include blackout button, select all lights and select light types as added features.

In write up mention error of 0 indexing since channels are from 1 to 512 but arrays are zero indexed

Potentially mention robust design where values can only be changed through functions which have validation.

For the open windows, create a template and change the names within the classes

For colour mode in sequence window, have the colour chosen when colour mode is pressed?

Add confirm window to close edit sequence window if unsaved changes made. Same for sequence window itself.

Have effects as a property of the light. In send effects to lights (a function called in the main run loop), update the values of the channels depending on the current effect values.
These effect values should be stored in a dictionary so other effects can be added later so the dictionary will contain an effect value and the name of the effect e.g. {"chaser":50,"rainbow":0}

Have change colour and change intensity methods for all light classes so it can be generalised more easily

Is the accounts table in 3NF if the username is unique?

For creating error windows later use "ERROR" at the start of every error message.

Check pressing enter for ok/submit if present for all windows

Possibly put in stakeholder input that the logon/create account is not obvious what to input. Also make password input dots.
Also for stakeholder input add extra faders since 24 is not that many

Add confirm window to slider panel window removign light
